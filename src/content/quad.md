# Tech Center

You’ve found what’s left of the tech labs.  There are some radios and communication equipment that you might be able to make use of to reach mainland.  Until then, you have unlocked the ability to call/text anyone else who is currently in the labs with you at at this moment.  (Other people who find the labs later will be using different equipment/frequencies).

### YOU MAY NOT TEXT QR CODES OR GAME URLS.
